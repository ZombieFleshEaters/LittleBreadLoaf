            My name is Ewa Adams and I run probably the smallest artisan bakery
            in the world. It might be small but thanks to that you can be sure bread
            you buy here is fresh and contains natural ingredients only.

        <p class="lead">
            In Poland, where I come from we eat and bake A LOT of bread. There
            are hundreds of bakeries only in Warsaw and probably thousands in
            the whole country. We are addicted to a good bread and a good bread
            is mandatory ingredient in every Polish kitchen. Over 96%
            of Polish households buy bread on a daily basis.

    <div class="mt-5">
        <h5>What is Polish bread?</h5>
        <p class="lead">
            Polish bread is based on rye wholemeal flour and sourdough starter.
            Loaf should be dense inside and crunchy on the outside. Heavy but
            easy to digest. Contains a lot of seeds and is naturally fermented.
            Healthy and keeps you full for hours. Delicious so you get addicted.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            This website lets you order fresh sourdough bread and bread products
            to be delivered to your doorstep (if you love in Wellington, Peotone and
            Lower Hutt) or being picked up from my bakery in Lower Hutt.
