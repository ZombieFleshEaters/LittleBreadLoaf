        In Alicetown, hidden in the backyard, is the smallest
        Bakery in the world. It doesn't face the street, and
        when the wind blows down the street signs it's
        impossible to find it. Even Google maps doesn't show our
        little internal aisle, so if you haven’t been to my bakery yet
        please read these directions - otherwise you can get lost.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        31a Railway Avenue in Lower Hutt (Alicetown) that's
        Where I bake my bread. I share this place with Papa's Cakes -
        They make delicious cudtomized cakes and cupcakes. It takes
        15 minutes if you are driving from wellington.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        We are located on the back of 31a Railway Avenue
        (entrance by 31 marsden street – please see the map)
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        The best way to find us is to:
        <ol>
            <li class="lead">Drive up to 31 marsden street opposite side to big red City church building</li>
            <li class="lead">Take turn into a little aisle between spark and Panasonic buildings</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        Once you find me you will keep coming back.
