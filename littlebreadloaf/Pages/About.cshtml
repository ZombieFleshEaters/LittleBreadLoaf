            My name is Lynda McGregor, and I am one half of the dynamic duo that makes up Little Bread Loaf
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I am a foodie through and through and have always had a passion for baking and looking after people, manaakitanga is at the centre of who I am.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I originally trained as a chef over 30 years ago, and have had a long and varied career outside of the food industry since - which seems to have come full circle now as I look forward to absolutely making the most of this fantastic opportunity.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Looking forward to seeing you in the bakery soon!

            Lillian - Co-Owner
        </h4>
        <p class="lead">
            My name is Lillian, and I make up the other half of Little Bread Loaf alongside my good friend Lynda.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Although not a chef nor baker by trade, I am definitely a foodie! I love good food and grew up working in my mum's cafés, deli, and restaurant.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            While Lynda will be baking in the shop, I will be more behind the scenes, working on the business.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I have a passion for community, service, and manaakitanga. I am the Chair of Team Naenae Trust and started the Naenae Village Market with my friend, Jodie-Ann. I am on the committee of Gallery Music Centre, and I am on the Board at my daughter's school. I was a Charity Ambassador for Mothers Helpers in 2019 and I still continue to support this amazing organisation.
