    <h5>Farmer's markets in Wellington</h5>
    <p class="lead">

        On the weekends, you can find Little Bread Loaf stalls at the
        farmers markets in Wellington. There are exceptions of course as
        these events strongly depend on weather conditions. <br /><br />

        Every weekend, that is not overly rainy or windy, you can
        find my bread at two farmers markets in Wellington and enjoy my
        fresh baking!
